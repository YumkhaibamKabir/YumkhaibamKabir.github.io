    <p>Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was child. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried. Music gives me the needed refuge whenever  I feel like my head is spinning and  i just want to shut out everything around me. The good thing about music is that there is music for every ocassion and feeling. Whenever I feel depressed, I listen to sad songs. They guide me and keep me company during those trying moments. Another good things about music is that It is universal. </p></div>
